# 🧑‍💼 Employee Tracker

### A clean terminal-based employee manager for quickly handling departments, roles, and people in a MySQL database.

Employee Tracker is a Node.js CLI app built for the classic "company org data" workflow, but with a smoother setup and a more practical project structure. It lets you manage employees, roles, and departments from the terminal without touching SQL every time.

## 🧩 Project Snapshot

- `employee.js`: CLI flow, prompts, menus, and table display logic.
- `lib/query.js`: builds CRUD SQL queries and runs them with `mysql2/promise`.
- `lib/loadEnv.js`: lightweight `.env` loader so local secrets stay out of source code.
- `schema.sql`: creates `Departments`, `Roles`, and `Employees` tables.
- `seeds.sql`: inserts sample data for quick testing and demos.
- `Assets/`: screenshots/GIF used in documentation.
